## 💫 About Me

I'm a software engineer currently working at a major tech company.

I believe that **Agents will change the world** 🌍, and I'm actively contributing to making that future a reality.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

I'm currently working on **[mini-OpenCode](https://github.com/amszuidas/mini-opencode)** - a lightweight, minimalist agentic coding system designed to help newcomers understand how coding agents really work under the hood.

**mini-OpenCode** draws inspiration from:
- [Deer-Code](https://github.com/MagicCube/deer-code)
- [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)

The goal? Strip away the complexity and show the elegant simplicity of agentic systems. Perfect for learners who want to grasp the fundamentals before diving into production-grade tools.

**Come join the journey!** Check out **[mini-OpenCode](https://github.com/amszuidas/mini-opencode)** and let's build something amazing together.

## 🌱 What I Believe

- **Agents will change the world**
- Simplicity > over-engineering
- Understanding > black boxes
- Learning by building > learning by watching
